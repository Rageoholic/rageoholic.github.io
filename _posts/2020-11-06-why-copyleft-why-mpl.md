So one question I'm really anticipating is why everything in this site
is copyleft. The reason for that is because I'm an asshole. I do
believe in your right to sell software to some degree and I understand
why you would want to keep certain bits of code proprietary, plus
sometimes it's forced on you by someone who's platform you're shipping
on. That being said I still am going to be using a copyleft license,
albeit one that doesn't force you to make your entire project
copyleft, just the files that have code you take from me. If you want
to implement stuff and just look at my code as a reference I don't
really mind. But I am a strong believer in keeping information as open
as possible, and the MPL lets me do that while not being overly
burdensome in my opinion.
