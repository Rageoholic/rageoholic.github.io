Hello friends! I made this site to document working on something in
[Zig](http://ziglang.org), a programming language I'm really excited
for. I wanted to document me using a language I barely get to do a
thing I kind of sort of know how to do but haven't released anything
in! And let all of you kind people watch me bumble around! What could
possibly go wrong! It took a lot of work and I'm pretty sure I messed
up at *some* point but I think I have this blog working so let's get
started!
